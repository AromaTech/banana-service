The Famed Aroma Service!

Aroma allows developers and Product Owners to communicate and stay in touch with their Live Software.

Developers can be conveniently notified of Urgent events that occur
within their Applications or Micro-Service, with a system designed and built from the ground up for that purpose.

The Aroma Service can also be used to setup Service Health Checks and Alerts.

# Open Source

The Open Source version of the Aroma Service is fully functional, with the following things left out:

## No Payments
There are no payment collection systems built into the Service.

## No Authentication
There is no authentication system provided, although the interface is defined.
This is because we assume that you will host your own instance behind your firewall.
