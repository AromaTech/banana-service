[![Build Status](http://jenkins.sirwellington.tech/view/Banana/job/Banana%20Service/badge/icon)](http://jenkins.sirwellington.tech/view/Banana/job/Banana%20Service/)

The Famed Banana Service!

The Banana Service is Service Notifications for Developers.

Developers are able to be notified of Urgent events that occur
within the Micro-Services.

The Banana Service can also be used to setup Service
Health Checks and Alerts.

# Open Source

The Open Source version of the Banana Service is fully functional, with the following things left out:

## No Payments
There are no payment collection systems built into the Service.

## No Authentication
There is no authentication system provided, although the interface is defined. 
This is because we assume that you will host your own instance behind your firewall.
